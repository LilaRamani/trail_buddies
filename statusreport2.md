This week we added some bootsrap front end frameworks to the homepage of the site. 
It looks pretty good if I do say so myself with that fancy nav bar and dropdowns.
Good to know we can formulate nice-looking designs on the fly.

next week we should look into the add a hike forms and storing that data in a mongo db
bootstrap has some good stuff for making forms look agood also
