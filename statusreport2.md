Status report 2

Elliot:
	This week I experimented with some bootsrap front end frameworks on the homepage of the site. 
	It looks pretty good if I do say so myself with that fancy nav bar and dropdowns.
	Good to know we can formulate nice-looking designs on the fly.

	Next week, we should start integrating the functionality/styles from the original site into the
	experimental bootstrap version. 

Caroline:
	I added some javascript functions to the addhtml page: basically it checks that none of the fields are empty when submitting the add hike form. If all the fields are filled out, it displays a 
	confirmation message. I also reformatted some more of our html and updated one of the bootstrap
	versions of our files.

	Next week, we should add to that javascript function that I began writing so it stores the 
	information from the fields in a mongo database.
